# Introduction

K9 Labs is an open source initiative dedicated to creating tools for the BDSM, rubber, and kink communities. We strive to create software tools that will help these communities organize play, connect with others in the community, and plan events and conferences. Our focus will be on creating a unified visual design language that ties our projects together - fonts, color schemes, visual layouts - as well as ensuring a consistent user experience across all of our products.

Motivation

 We believe that creating software specifically tailored to the needs of the BDSM, rubber and kink communities will have many benefits for them. The software we create can help these communities come together more easily to enjoy activities they love; it can help take the guesswork out of planning events or meetups; it can provide a safe space while offering friends and peers support. Not only will our open source project benefit these specific audiences but we also feel that it has wider implications for building software used across all consumer segments - ultimately making it easier for people from all walks of life to find solutions that meet their needs.

Goals

  1) Create a unified visual design language for use across K9 Labs projects – this includes fonts, color schemes, visual layouts etc 
2) Ensure a consistent user experience across K9 Labs products – this includes ensuring a centralized approach to UX design 
3) Develop effective tools to organize events and conferences – create scheduling software which allows users to quickly & conveniently set up meetings/events 
4) Create connection & messaging tools specifically designed to serve the BDSM & kink community – facilitate easy communication within these chosen audiences 
5) Design processes & resources which make development of new K9 labs projects straightforward & efficient 
6) Develop an online platform where users can access resources related to safety & health education in BDSM/kink play 
7) Maintain an active presence within the BDSM/kink community – keep up-to-date with relevant trends & developments in order to ensure projects remain relevant over time 



Contributor Requirements & Guidelines

  1) Open source contributors must agree to adhere to the code of conduct found on K9 Labs’ GitHub page at all times  
2) All code submitted must adhere strictly to industry-standard coding best practices  
3) All code must be thoroughly tested before submission  
4) Contributors must strive towards meeting deadlines as set by project administrators  
5) Design contributions should also meet certain technical criteria – layout designs must fall within pre-established specifications/constraints in order for them be accepted into official builds  

Design Principles

The following design principles should guide developer decision making when working on K9 Labs projects:   

 1) Clarity: Designs should be kept simple with clarity being paramount    2) Consistency: Designs should remain consistent throughout all products in order for users not become frustrated or confused by switching from one product another    3) Usability: Designs should facilitate easy task completion whilst optimizing user experience    4) Accessibility: Designs should be accessible for people with disabilities    5) Adaptability: Designs should allow users options in how they interact with products. Allow them personalize settings if necessary

# K9 Labs : An Open Source BDSM, Rubber, and Kink Software Contribution and Design Document

K9 Labs is an open source initiative focused on creating software tools for the BDSM, rubber and kink communities to organize play, connect people, and organize events/conferences. This project will include fonts, color schemes and visual layouts to help create a cohesive UI. The source code will be made freely available both in its current state and as updates are released. 

## Goals 
The primary purpose of this project is to make it easier for members of the BDSM, rubber and kink communities to interact with each other on an organized platform without compromising individual privacy. We also seek to encourage communication between users through features such as event organization and planning tools.

K9 Labs will include the following components: 
* Event organization tools 
* Social networking components (including user profiles) 
* Color palette design module  
* Font Library (with multiple font categories)  
* Visual layout templates  

 Additionally, the project will integrate security measures that protect the privacy of users (e.g., two-factor authentication). The software will be tested on multiple platforms before being released. Finally, we plan to build a vibrant community around K9 Labs by encouraging feedback from our users as well as providing forums for discussion on topics related to BDSM, rubber and kink activity.
