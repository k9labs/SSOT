## Introduction

At K9 Labs, we are committed to creating an engaging and meaningful open source experience for our BDSM, rubber and kink communities. We want to ensure that developers have an efficient, organized, and well-designed contribution process that produces quality outcomes with each pull request.

This document contains instructions and guidelines for contributing to K9 Labs initiatives. It should be read carefully before any contributions are made in order to familiarize yourself with our standards and expectations.

## Fonts

We recommend using fonts which are optimized for readability, legibility, and clarity of text:

- Serif: Arial, Times New Roman
- Sans serif: Helvetica, Verdana

## Color Schemes

The primary color scheme is monochromatic; it contains shades of black and dark gray (not pure black). Any other colors used should be minor accents that don’t overwhelm the overall design scheme.

### Shades of Black / Gray

- Primary (Darkest): #2A2B2C     (42 43 44) - This is the darkest gray used as the focus color of the website or application design.
- Secondary (Light Gray): #6B6D6E  (107 109 110) - This is a lighter gray used as an accent or backdrop color of the website or application design.  

## Visual Layouts

We prefer simple yet effective designs which utilize minimalism principles when constructing layouts. The focus should always be on usability; layouts should provide a logical flow between elements so users can quickly find what they’re looking for without feeling overwhelmed by an excessive amount of visual distractions or overly complex navigation structures .
